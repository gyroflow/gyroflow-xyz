For general support, discussion, and user feedback, the best place is the Discord server where all the developers hang out: 

<a href="https://discord.gg/BBJ2UVAr2D" class="btn btn--info btn--large">Gyroflow Discord</a>

Furthermore, the FPV Stabilization Tools group has a large number of active users discussing Gyroflow and related tools:

For companies or people wishing to get in touch with the team privately, you can reach us through email at: [devteam@gyroflow.xyz](mailto:devteam@gyroflow.xyz)

Since the previous beta release, a number of camera vendors have been in contact in order to add native Gyroflow support, so if this sounds interesting, feel free to shoot a mail our way.
