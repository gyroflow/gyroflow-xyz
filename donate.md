The Gyroflow project was initially a [Python program](https://github.com/ElvinC/gyroflow) started by [Elvin](https://elvinchen.com/) in 2020. Elvin is currently one of the developers working on software and hardware development:

Version 1.0 and onwards was made possible by <a href="https://github.com/adrianEddy">AdrianEddy</a>, the main developer of the current high-performance and cross-platform codebase written in Rust. AdrianEddy is currently raising funds for native BRAW video support:

Furthermore, many other amazing contributors have helped during the development in order to discuss, test, and implement new ideas for video stabilization. You can find them on the contributors list of the [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/gyroflow). None of this would be possible without the help and support of everyone involved, including users who provided helpful feedback.
