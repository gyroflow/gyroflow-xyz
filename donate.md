The Gyroflow project was initially a [Python program](https://github.com/ElvinC/gyroflow) started by [Elvin](https://elvinchen.com/) in 2020. Elvin is currently one of the developers working on software and hardware development:

Version 1.0 and onwards was made possible by AdrianEddy, who worked overtime on adapting the previous Python codebase to high-performance cross-platform Rust code with a modern UI, and implemented new advanced features. Find AdrianEddy on Github:

Furthermore, many other amazing contributors have helped during the development in order to discuss, test, and implement new ideas for video stabilization. You can find them on the contributors list of the [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/gyroflow). None of this would be possible without the help and support of everyone involved, including users who provided helpful feedback.
